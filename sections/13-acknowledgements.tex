This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission {\it Gaia} (\url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia}), processed by the {\it Gaia} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC, \url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium}).
Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating in the {\it Gaia} Multilateral Agreement.

We thank the members of the community that have contributed to the \sunpyproj, that have opened issues and provided feedback, and have supported the project in a number of other ways.

TODO: Thank GSoC, ESA/SOCIS for studentships, NumFOCUS (and possibly PSF) for direct funding.
Highlight institutions who let their staff work part FTE on Sunpy as part of their job.
