\section{Community}
\label{sec:community}

As discussed in \citet{bangerth2013}, a vital component to the long-term success of a project requires building a healthy community of users, developers, and maintainers.
The \sunpyproj has taken a number of steps to nurture and grow the SunPy community.
We've adopted a formal code of conduct. 
The SunPy Code of Conduct\footnote{\url{https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_of_conduct.html}} strives to foster an open, considerate, and respectful environment for all.
We maintain a number of active communication channels.
These include a mailing lists, real-time chat based on the open source matrix\footnote{\url{https://matrix.org}}, and weekly telecons.
SunPy community members have also lead tutorials at international conferences, participated in summer programs, and provided mentorships.
Developers and contributors are currently provided credit for their work by authorship on papers, posters, and release notes.

As of the publication of this paper, the SunPy developer community consists of 113 contributors (see Figure~\ref{fig:metafig}), that generate an average of approximately 200 commits every month.
This suggests that some of the efforts described above have been successful though it should be noted that the right-most panel of Figure~/ref{fig:metafig} shows that most of the development is provided by a very small group.
